# The Changing Role of Institutions, and its Effect on Trust and Access to Knowledge
This repository is the one stop shop for research and outputs from my senior fellowship, supported by the Mozilla Foundation. 

## The Problem:
The systems that underpin the free flow of information online are becoming increasingly fraught. In the past few months, there's been increased attention to issues surrounding data access, preservation and our right to free and open knowledge. “Data Rescue” and "Data Refuge" events are rapidly emerging as a call to arms for the information community - bringing together those from the mapping and data communities, librarians, researchers, and concerned citizens to preserve taxpayer-funded data that's high value and/or "at-risk" to ensure access and build resilience in our information systems. 

This has spurred a collective rethink about the systems we rely on to provide unfettered, unbiased, public information, and what our relationship to those systems and the information they provide is. What does an information economy look like when you can no longer trust the publicly-funded institution - be it government agency, research institution, or library - and how does that affect our understanding of truth? What opportunities are there for federated knowledge sharing and governance in the wake of “controversial” publicly-funded data being erased if it doesn’t fit  with a politician’s view of the world? 

This fellowship will research the facets of the public’s access as well as trust in information and bring together key members of communities working on information issues to rethink what opportunities exist to build collaborative systems to serve the public interest and preserve access, preservation and sustainability of knowledge and trust in information. 

## The Opportunity:
This fellowship will conduct research with and for the public interest tech community (PIT), both at the organizational and individual level, through working together on a common and timely cause - the threats to public access of information. Currently, work in this space is happening in piecemeal, uncoordinated ways, presenting a unique research opportunity and case study, as well as a space to provide leadership and coordination. This work will research issues that lie at the intersection of civil society, institutions and government, directly engaging members from each of these stakeholder groups to explore shared, coordinated approaches to information sharing and Internet health. 

## Questions to Address:

- What have been effective methodologies for restoring trust in civic institutions?
- What is the relationship between trust and access to information? 
- What are the threats and challenges facing access and utility of information? 
- Is there a place for cross-institutional, shared systems in providing better access, increased persistence and trust to civil society? If so, what would that look like? 
- What role is there for institutions in an increasingly disintermediated, decentralized information economy?
